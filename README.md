# 🧠 Personality Predictor

A machine learning project to classify whether a person is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert** using a custom logistic regression model and an interactive Streamlit app.

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores how behavioral features can be used to predict personality traits. It includes data cleaning, manual feature scaling, logistic regression from scratch, and a Streamlit web app for predictions and visualizing gradient descent.
